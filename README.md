Project Full Description:
The game was developed using  (Open Graphics Library) is a cross-platform application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics,C++ programming language, and SFML library, which provides a simple and efficient interface for creating 2D games.

To create the game, first we initialized the game window which is 800 by 600 name as endless runner.We added background images to create a new gaming experience and The game's main loop updates in every frame and set the game loop to run continuously. Then, we added game objects such as the player character and obstacles to the game world and update the position of the player character and obstacles.
 
We also implemented collision detection of player and obstacle.

To  detect collision between player and obstacle at first we get the globalbounds of player and obstacle and check whether they intersect or not   if the player character collided with an obstacle, resulting the player will kill and the game ending.

The player controls the player character, who must run and,crouch ,jump  over obstacles to avoid colliding with them.

Player will 

Jump ( ⬆️ ) when up arrow pressed and
Crouch when down ( ⬇️ ) arrow pressed
Restart the game we've to pressed Space (⌨️).
